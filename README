v1.2
  New title font
  Title font effects
  Title, buttons, and button margins resize with window

v2.0
  Bug fixes with buttons staying pressed, being mis-clicked
  Customizable hot keys. (must be alphanumeric, non-numpad)
  TODO:
  New custom buttons for "Start", "game mode" and "player stats"


(NOW):
-allow remote access (so can play on other devices)
  (try configuring sshd, maybe use ngrok, labstack subdomain?)
  (JUST SET UP RASPBERRY PI WEB SERVER)
-->Disable button presses (i.e. hover/pressed effects) during sequence
-hotkeys: more default configurations
(DONE) toggle buttons: sound on/off, upload or save on/off
-leaderboard: show leaderboard (get data from database)
-full screen mode
-dark mode / light mode (different colors)
-->...sounds: loading and playing speed (try different techniques)


--------------
## BUGS:
Button stays in pressed state (i.e. brightness 0.8) in mobile

## Visual:
Add buttons: Mute (sound off by default), Upload (on by default)
--> Disable button presses (i.e. hover/pressed effects) during sequence
Add gray gradient/ombre tone to window background, ombre colors to button colors
Optimize for mobile (?)
Change game mode buttons into one button with drop down menu (on hover/click)
Custom svg buttons for layout, leaderboard, trophy buttons

--> Hotkeys
            - different default hot keys configurations (store as constants); change with layout changes
            - add ability to change all hot keys quickly, one after another

Light mode / Dark mode (?)

## Gameplay:
 (DONE) Userid field: only allow 3 letter input; add "i" info button -> "Input id before game start to save score with this id" (*Have users choose permanent id? Login?*)

Do more efficient sound stuff (load in a lot, cycle through them ?)

Have sound work for advanced mode too (fluid- add delay after correct input ?)
--> Add sound (!)
      - make them 70s/80s synth sounds (user can change?)
      - you have a midi keyboard in the game (!!!) -> game: (see game mode ideas below)
                                                   -> eggs: certain key sequences (either in game or/and not during game)
                                                            will play song, change background, etc.
--> Full screen mode (NOTE: will need to change how layout changes, i.e. by changing div width, to make this work)
... & exit and restart buttons
... should be different on mobile
--> Add trophies

Add "Player Score/ Career Points"... figure out conversion between number of buttons
(Maybe) slider to change size of buttons
***New button appears every N successful rounds*** *part of Gauntlet mode ?*
Add "Quit/Reset" option to stop sequence in classic


## BACKEND:
GET leaderboard data (top 50?) in desired category. Add filter options? (!!!)
Make database for user preferences, user progress/trophies/data, etc.



## STYLE:
--> Make button handlers/helpers for visual and audio effects on click (!!!)
Change global names to 'g...' to track where they are used
Put all event listeners in one file, all front-end game code in one, helper code in another etc.
Be consistent with quote marks


--------------
(DONE)


## BUGS:
(FIXED) Weird results when you try to assign certain keys as hotkeys, e.g. space, backspace, ...
(FIXED) ... & when you assign from left of current character
(FIXED) Button stays highlighted after game loss

## Visual:
Add button layout options
    (DONE) (** first: add buttons for testing: plus, minus, linear, square)
    (DONE) Disable buttons during active game (e.g. if isGameStart...), or outside of bounds 2-12
    (DONE) Handler - changes div width dimension, bttn display settings, etc. depending on layout;
              (above: Linear: 2 rows, 6/row; Square: 3 rows, 3/row; adjust width as necessary)
              updates colorMap, num_butts, etc.
              (above: these can be done by an update() helper function)

(DONE) Fix padding/margins of text elements
(DONE) Custom buttons
(DONE) Change game button colors

## Gameplay:
(DONE) Make different hi scores (adv and cla) for different button levels.
(DONE) Add Leaderboard - make ***database***, prompt for user id/"nick name", save with score (Add SVG icon)

(DONE) "Freeze" user input in middle of Classic sequence to avoid mis-click
(DONE) Add keyboard functionality -> can enter key presses to play game.
(DONE) Make hotkeys customizable (i.e. any alphanumeric key can be made a hotkey)
... & make plugin to map all keys correctly (keyCode -> charCode)

Add more Game Modes:
  Reaction time game - sequence flashes, reproduce it; can be played 1v1 on on computer, or more on multiple devices
  Rhythm game - maybe like "necrodancer", "guitar hero", "rhythm heaven fever" -

## Backend:
(DONE) Make databases for leaderboard



## Eggs:
--> If in square mode, 12 buttons, click rainbow (and not during game) -> buttons will do rainbow wave
Make 1/100 chance title will be spelled "Simoan" -> click and moan sound effect plays
--> certain sound
(DONE) Rainbow title


CODE NOTE(s):
Using .style to get element attribute set with css .class selector will NOT give
result. Must use getComputedStyle(),
e.g. var style = window.getComputedStyle(obj); var color = obj.color;
